# NOTE: the assignment instructions were not clear about the necessity of this code book, so I created it after the submission deadline.

Raw data obtained on the following adress:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Full data description is available on the following webpage:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The code in run_analysis.r only works if it is located in the same folder as the unzipped dataset.

The dataset created by the code only focuses on variables of type "mean" or "standard deviation" from the raw dataset. 
The dataset presents, for each Subject and for each type of Activity, the mean value of each variable.

The list of dataset variables is given here after:

ActName: Name of activity
SubjID: ID of Subject performing the activity

tBodyAcc-mean()-X
tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
tBodyAcc-std()-X

The meaning of those variables is detailed in the file "features_info.txt" of the original dataset. The tidy dataset includes the mean of each variable for each subject and each activity.
